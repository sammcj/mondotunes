Do Make Say Think - The Apartment Song
Do Make Say Think is an instrumental group from Toronto, Ontario. The band formed in the 1990s(1995) by Charles Spearin as a recording project for his sound engineering classes in college. Their first rehearsals took place in an empty schoolroom where four basic verbs &#8212; Do, Make, Say and Think &#8212; adorned the walls. The group subsequently adopted the words as a name. Their music combines jazz-style drums with electric bass, synthesizers, electric guitars, wind instruments, and electronic effects.
