"<b>Moonlight Mile</b>" is a song from <a title="The Rolling Stones" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>' 1971 album <i><a title="Sticky Fingers" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sticky_Fingers">Sticky Fingers</a></i>.
Credited to <a title="Mick Jagger" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Jagger">Mick Jagger</a> and <a title="Keith Richards" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Richards">Keith Richards</a>, "Moonlight Mile" is widely considered to be one of the Rolling Stones' most underappreciated <a title="Ballads" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballads">ballads</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-allmusic_1-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_(song)#cite_note-allmusic-1">[1]</a></sup> Recording began in March 1970 at <a title="Stargroves" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargroves">Stargroves</a>. The song was the product of an all-night session between Jagger and guitarist <a title="Mick Taylor" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Taylor">Mick Taylor</a>. Taylor had taken a short guitar piece recorded by Richards (entitled "Japanese Thing") and reworked it for the session. Jagger performs the song's prominent <a title="Acoustic guitar" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_guitar">acoustic guitar</a> riff. Jagger felt it easier to extemporize with Taylor, as Richards was not present. It was Taylor's idea to add a string arrangement by <a title="Paul Buckmaster" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Buckmaster">Paul Buckmaster</a> to the song. Piano is played by regular Rolling Stones trumpet player <a title="Jim Price (musician)" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Price_(musician)">Jim Price</a>.

"Moonlight Mile was all Mick's. As far as I can remember, Mick came in with the whole idea of that, and the band just figured out how to play it.<sup id="cite_ref-Richards.27_Life_magazine_quote_2-0"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_(song)#cite_note-Richards.27_Life_magazine_quote-2">[2]</a></sup> - Keith Richards, <i>Life</i> magazine

The lyrics are elliptical and mysterious, but touch on the alienation of life on the road.

In his review of the song, <a title="Bill Janovitz" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Janovitz">Bill Janovitz</a> says, "Though the song still referenced drugs and the road life of a pop-music celebrity, it really is a rare example of Jagger letting go of his public persona, offering a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the weariness that accompanies the pressures of keeping up appearances as a sex-drugs-and-rock &amp; roll star."<sup id="cite_ref-allmusic_1-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_(song)#cite_note-allmusic-1">[1]</a></sup> Rock critic <a title="Robert Christgau" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> said the song, "re-created all the paradoxical distances inherent in erotic love with a power worthy of <a title="William Butler Yeats" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Butler_Yeats">Yeats</a>, yet could also be interpreted as a <a title="Cocaine" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine">cocaine</a> song."<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonlight_Mile_(song)#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> This is a reference to the first stanza, which reads, "<i>When the wind blows and the rain feels cold, With a head full of snow...</i>" .
