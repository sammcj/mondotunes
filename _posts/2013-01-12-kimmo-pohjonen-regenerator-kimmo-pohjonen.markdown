Kimmo Pohjonen - &#8220;Regenerator"
<span>Kimmo Pohjonen (b. 1964) is one of the most respected and in-demand musicians and performers in Finland. An accordionist of exceptional ability and imagination, Kimmo&#8217;s musical history goes back more than twenty years in rock, folk, avant-garde, improvisation, classical, dance and theatre music projects. In 1996 he embarked on a solo career with his solo 5-row accordion project, featuring extreme and original compositions, live loops and effects, a dynamic and animated stage performance, orchestrated lights and surround sound.</span>
