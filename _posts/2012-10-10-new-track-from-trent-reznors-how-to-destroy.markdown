New Track From Trent Reznor&#8217;s How to Destroy Angels: &#8220;Keep It Together"
<strong>From pitchfork:</strong>
<a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/28841-how-to-destroy-angels/" target="_nk">How to destroy angels_</a>, <a href="http://pitchfork.com/artists/6209-trent-reznor/" target="_nk">Trent Reznor</a>&#8217;s project with his wife Mariqueen Maandig and longtime collaborators Rob Sheridan and Atticus Ross, will release their <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47970-trent-reznors-how-to-destroy-angels-share-an-omen-ep-cover-art/" target="_nk"><em>An omen_</em> EP</a> on November 13 via <a href="http://www.columbiarecords.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_nk">Columbia</a>. Here&#8217;s the first single from the EP, &#8220;Keep it together". The track may also make an appearance on the band&#8217;s upcoming album, which is due out next year. That&#8217;s the single artwork up there, too.
Read the band&#8217;s statement about signing to Columbia <a href="http://pitchfork.com/news/47941-trent-reznors-how-to-destroy-angels-announce-new-ep-sign-to-columbia-records/" target="_nk">here</a>.
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Copyeditors take note: Apparently, the band has decided that they&#8217;re only capitalizing the first letter of everything, and adding underscores in random places. So the project is called How to destroy angels_ and the EP is called <em>An omen_</em> EP and the song is called &#8220;Keep it together".
