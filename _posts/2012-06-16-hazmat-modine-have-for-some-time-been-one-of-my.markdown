Hazmat Modine have for some time been one of my all time most enjoyed groups, their extensive range of musical influences and cultural diversity mixed with a profound musical understanding and topped off by a brilliant sense of humour - never cease to amaze me.  
If you&#8217;re like me and you &#8216;obtain&#8217; a lot of music online, if you only buy the odd album that really blows you away, please let that album but one of the two Hazmat Modine albums, either the Bahamut or the recently released and highly acclaimed Cicada.
Every track, thats right EVERY track on both of their two albums has been created with such an exquisite level of passion, I can honestly say that there isn&#8217;t a single song that I do not enjoy on either album.
Tonight for Mondo Tunes,
I present, their new video for Mockingbird, turn the HiFi or headphones up, sit back and enjoy.
Sam Mondo.
