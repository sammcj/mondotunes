Lay with me - The Flying Eyes
<span>The Flying Eyes are a heavy, psychedelic rock band hailing from Baltimore, Maryland. Since forming in 2007, they have opened for artists like The Black Keys (SXSW 2009), The Black Angels, Dead Meadow etc. The band&#8217;s vocalist, Will Kelly is hauntingly reminiscent of Jim Morrison with his gravelly, boozy vocals and so is the sexual undertone of most of their songs, and occasionally, ends up sounding like Glenn Danzig on the dead end of the night. Searing riffs evoke the late 60s acid-head era and exits in a superb, fuzzed and reverb-heavy sonic atmosphere.</span>
