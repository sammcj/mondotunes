Evelyn Glennie - Fred Frith, A Little Prayer
<blockquote>
Glennie has been <a title="Profound hearing loss" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profound_hearing_loss" target="_nk">profoundly deaf</a> since age 12. This does not inhibit her ability to perform at the international level. She regularly plays <a title="Barefoot" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barefoot" target="_nk">barefoot</a> during both live performances and studio recordings in order to better &#8220;feel" the music.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evelyn_Glennie#cite_note-1" target="_nk"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup>
Glennie contends that deafness is largely misunderstood by the  public. She claims to have taught herself to hear with parts of her body  other than her ears. In response to criticism from the media, Glennie  published <a href="http://www.evelyn.co.uk/hearing_essay.aspx" target="_nk"><em>Hearing Essay</em></a> in which she personally discusses her condition.
