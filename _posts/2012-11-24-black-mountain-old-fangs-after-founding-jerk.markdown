Black Mountain - Old Fangs
<p class="p1">After founding Jerk with a Bomb in the late &#8217;90s, Stephen McBean had by the mid-2000s transformed the Vancouver-area band into a group called Black Mountain. Drawing on blues, psychedelia, acid rock, and the Velvet Underground, Black Mountain&#8217;s sound was a cross between the darkness and grit of the Warlocks and Brian Jonestown Massacre&#8217;s trippiness. After debuting in October 2004 on Jagjaguwar with the 12" Druganaut, Black Mountain stayed with the label for an eponymous full-length, issued the following January.
