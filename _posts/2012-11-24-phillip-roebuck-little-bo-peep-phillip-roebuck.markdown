Phillip Roebuck - LITTLE BO PEEP
PHILLIP ROEBUCK is a Virginia-born, New York-bred songster and bare bones one-man band. With punk rock intensity, Roebuck stomps out beats on a classic, depression-era drum apparatus, while strumming the banjo with a fierce ragged-but-right style. Some might call it Roots music for the new millennium. Although he has played over a thousand shows in venues and on festival stages in the U.S. and Europe, Roebuck can just as easily be seen performing on a street corner in New Orleans or New York City or Norfolk, where he has spent nearly a decade honing his skills as a one-man band.
