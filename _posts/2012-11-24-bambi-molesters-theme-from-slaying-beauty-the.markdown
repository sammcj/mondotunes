Bambi Molesters - Theme From Slaying Beauty
The Bambi Molesters are a surf rock band from Sisak, Croatia. Since their formation in 1995, they have taken part in the revival of the 1960s surf genre and continue to significantly contribute to its survival and further development with their critically acclaimed music. The Bambi Molesters perform regularly in Croatia and all over europe, often opening for popular american rock band R.E.M.. Their sound has been compared to the music of Ennio Morricone, though they have managed to successfully build their own reputation as one of the finest and most innovative contemporary surf rock bands.
